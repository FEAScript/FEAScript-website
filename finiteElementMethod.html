      The finite element method is a discretization technique that can utilize a computational mesh to
      approximate the solution of a partial differential equation. Basic concepts of the finite element method
      are described below.

      Consider a typical formulation of a boundary value problem (BVP): $$\begin{eqnarray} Lu &= f \quad
      \text{in} \quad D, \\ Bu &= g \quad \text{on} \quad \partial D. \end{eqnarray} \tag{1}$$ The solution
      \(u\) is a function of the position vector \(\bar{x}\) at the domain \(D\), which is a subregion of a
      one-, two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space. The position vector \(\bar{x}\) is defined as: \(
      \bar{x} =\sum_{i=1} ^{n} x_i e_i\), where \(e_i\) are the unit vectors and \(n\) is the dimension of the
      Euclidean space. \(L\) is the differential operator and \(B\) is a boundary operator defined at the
      boundary \(\partial D\). The solution \(u\) can be approximated using a linear combination of basis
      functions \(\phi^1, \phi^2, \phi^3, \dots, \phi^N\) such that: \( u(x) = \sum_{j=1} ^{N} u_j
      \phi^j(x)\), where the number of basis functions equals the number of nodes of the computational mesh.
      The Galerkin method seeks a solution that zeroes out every one of the following weighted residuals: $$
      \begin{aligned} R_i &= \int_{D} (Lu - f) \phi^i \, dS \\ &= \int_{D} \phi^i \left( L\left( \sum_{j=1}^N
      u_j \phi^j \right) \right) \, dS - \int_{D} f \phi^i \, dS \\ &\quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, 2, \dots,
      N. \end{aligned} \tag{2} $$ These integrals depend solely on the nodal values \(u_j\), which are the
      unknowns to be determined. The number of residuals is equal to the number of basis functions, which in
      turn is equal to the number of nodes, \(N\), in the computational mesh. Setting the Galerkin residuals
      to zero leads to a system of \(N\) algebraic equations with \(N\) unknowns, which can be solved to
      obtain the approximate solution.
    </p>
    <h2 id="boundaryconditions"><a name="Boundary Conditions"></a>Boundary Conditions</h2>
    <p>
      In general, there are three common types of boundary conditions that can be imposed in boundary value
      problems: Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions. The boundary conditions that specify the
      value of \(u\) on a portion of \( \partial D\) are called Dirichlet boundary conditions, and they are
      imposed directly in the discretization equations. In particular, the Dirichlet boundary conditions
      replace the Galerkin residuals at the computational nodes that lie on the portion of the boundary where
      the solution value is prescribed. Consider, for example, a boundary node \(n\) at position \(t_n\),
      where the solution is defined by the boundary condition \(u = F(t)\), with \(F(t)\) being a known
      function of the position \(t\) on \(\partial D\). In this case, the \(n\)-th residual is replaced by:
      \(R_n = u_n - F(t_n)\).
    </p>
    <p>
      The boundary conditions that define the value of the derivative of \(u\) on a portion of \(\partial D\)
      are called Neumann (or natural) boundary conditions. These are imposed indirectly in the discretization
      equations. Consider that the highest rank of differentiation of the operator \(L\) is \(
      \frac{d^m}{dx^m} \). The corresponding integral at the residuals will be: $$I_m = \int_{D} \phi^i
      \frac{d^m u}{dx^m} \, dx. \tag{3}$$ By applying integration by parts, we get: $$ I_m = \oint_{\partial
      D} \phi^i \frac{d^{m-1} u}{dx^{m-1}} \, dt - \int_{D} \frac{d\phi^i}{dx} \frac{d^{m-1} u}{dx^{m-1}} \,
      dx, \tag{4}$$ where \(t\) is the independent variable at the boundary \(\partial D\). A boundary
      condition of \(m-1\) rank is imposed at the line integral. Thus, in the case where the Neumann boundary
      condition is \( \frac{d^{m-1}u}{dx^{m-1}} = g(t) \) on \(\partial D\), where \(g(t)\) is a known
      function, then: $$ I_m = \oint_{\partial D} \phi^i g(t) \, dt - \int_{D} \frac{d\phi^i}{dx}
      \frac{d^{m-1} u}{dx^{m-1}} \, dx. \tag{5}$$ If the Neumann boundary condition has a rank \(k < (m-1)\),
      then we continue to apply integration by parts until the \(k\)-th rank derivative appears on the line
      integral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Robin boundary conditions, also known as mixed boundary conditions, specify a linear
      combination of the function \(u\) and its derivative on a portion of \(\partial D\). These are imposed
      in a similar fashion to the Neumann boundary conditions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="isoparametricmapping"><a name="Isoparametric Mapping"></a>Isoparametric Mapping</h2>
    <p>
      The basis functions are defined on reference elements: on the unit interval \(0 \le \xi \le 1\) in 1D,
      and on the unit square \(0 \le \xi \le 1\), \(0 \le \eta \le 1\) in 2D. However, the basis functions
      also need to be mapped to the initial domain \(D\) of the BVP since the solution \(u\) is approximated
      by basis functions defined on \(D\). The change from the \(\bar{\xi}\) system to the \(\bar{x}\) system
      is performed through isoparametric mapping, where \(\bar{\xi} = (\xi, \eta)\) and \(\bar{x} = (x, y)\).
      In this process, the reference element is mapped to every element of the computational mesh on \(D\).
      The same basis functions are used for the mapping: $$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \bar{x_i} \phi_i(\xi),
      \tag{6}$$ where \(\bar{x}\) is the position vector of the mesh element, \(\bar{x_i}\) is the position
      vector of the \(i\)-th node in local numbering of the mesh element, \(\bar{\xi}\) is the position vector
      of the reference element, and \(n_k\) is the number of nodes in the reference element. Keep in mind that
      \(\phi_i\) corresponds to the local basis function, where \(i\) is the local number of the node in the
      reference element (as opposed to the global definition of the basis function \(\phi^i\), where \(i\)
      corresponds to the global node number in this case).
    </p>
    <p>
      From the above mapping, we can define the reverse mapping from \(\bar{x}\) to \(\bar{\xi}\). The reverse
      mapping is calculated by solving the isoparametric mapping relation (Eq. (6)) for \(\bar{\xi}\) as a
      function of \(\bar{x}\): \(\bar{\xi} = \bar{\xi}(\bar{x})\). The basis functions are then expressed in
      the coordinate system of \(D\) (the \(\bar{x}\) system) as \(\phi_i(\bar{\xi}(\bar{x}))\), where \(i =
      1, 2, \dots, n_k\). In the case where \(D\) is a two-dimensional domain, the Jacobian of the mapping is
      the matrix: $$ \bar{\bar{J}} = \begin{vmatrix} x_{\xi} & y_{\xi} \\ x_{\eta} & y_{\eta} \end{vmatrix},
      \tag{7}$$ where \( x_{\xi} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi}\), \( y_{\xi} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial
      \xi}\), \( x_{\eta} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta}\), \( y_{\eta} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial
      \eta}\). The relation between the \(\bar{x}\)- and \(\bar{\xi}\)-partial derivatives of the basis
      function can also be calculated as: $$ \bar{\bar{J}} \begin{vmatrix} \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial x}
      \\ \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial y} \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial
      \xi} \\ \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial \eta} \end{vmatrix}. \tag{8} $$ By solving the above equation,
      we can calculate the partial derivatives of the basis function with respect to \(x\) and \(y\): $$
      \begin{eqnarray} \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial x} &=& \frac{1}{\text{det}\bar{\bar{J}}} \left(
      y_{\eta} \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial \xi} - y_{\xi} \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial \eta} \right),
      \\ \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial y} &=& \frac{1}{\text{det}\bar{\bar{J}}} \left( x_{\xi}
      \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial \eta} - x_{\eta} \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial \xi} \right).
      \end{eqnarray} \tag{9}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      where \(\text{det}\bar{\bar{J}}\) is the determinant of the Jacobian: \( \text{det}\bar{\bar{J}} =
      x_{\xi} y_{\eta} - x_{\eta} y_{\xi}.\) In the case where \(D\) is a one-dimensional domain, Eq. (6) is
      reduced to: \( x = \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} x_i \phi_i(\xi). \) The Jacobian of the mapping in this case is: \(
      J = \frac{dx}{d\xi} = x_{\xi}, \) and the partial derivative of the basis function is: \(
      \frac{d\phi_i}{dx} = \frac{d\phi_i}{d\xi} \Big/ x_{\xi}. \)
    </p>

    <h2 id="residualscomputation"><a name="Residuals Computation"> </a>Residuals Computation</h2>
    <p>
      A typical representative of the integrals in the Galerkin residuals is the following: $$ I_{ij} =
      \int_{D} \phi^i L \phi^j \, d\bar{x}. \tag{10} $$ The computational mesh covering \(D\) consists of
      \(NE\) finite elements \(E_k\) \((k = 1, 2, \dots, NE)\). Thus, the integral \(I_{ij}\) is the sum of
      the partial integrals: $$ \begin{aligned} I_{ij} &= \sum_{k=1}^{NE} I_{ij}^k, \\ I_{ij}^k &\equiv
      \int_{E_k} \phi^i L \phi^j \, d\bar{x}. \end{aligned} \tag{11} $$ Each of the integrals \(I_{ij}^k\) is
      calculated through the isoparametric mapping by transforming the coordinate system as follows: $$
      I_{ij}^k = \int_{E_0} \phi_i(\bar{\xi}) L_{\bar{\xi}} \phi_j(\bar{\xi}) \, \text{det}(\bar{\bar{J}}) \,
      d\bar{\xi}, \tag{12} $$ where \(E_0\) is the reference element, and \(L_{\bar{\xi}}\) is the
      differential operator expressed in the \(\bar{\xi}\)-coordinate system. The integrals of the
      discretization equations are then calculated numerically on the reference element. Specifically, these
      calculations are performed using the Gauss quadrature method: $$ \int_{E_0} f(\bar{\xi}) \, d\bar{\xi} =
      \sum_{k=1}^{NGP} w_k f(\bar{\xi}_{gk}), \tag{13} $$ where \(w_k\) are the Gauss weights,
      \(\bar{\xi}_{gk}\) are the Gauss points inside the reference element where the integrand is evaluated,
      and \(NGP\) is the number of Gauss points.
